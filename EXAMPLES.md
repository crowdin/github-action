          project_id: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID }}
          token: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}

### Download only translations without pushing to a branch

It's possible only to download the translations without immediate PR creation.
It allows you to post-process the downloaded translations and create a PR later.

```yaml
name: Crowdin Action

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  crowdin:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Crowdin pull
        uses: crowdin/github-action@v1
        with:
          upload_sources: false
          upload_translations: false
          download_translations: true
          create_pull_request: false
          push_translations: false
        env:
          CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID }}
          CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
```

### Advanced Pull Request configuration

There is a possibility to specify labels, assignees, reviewers for PR created by the Action.

```yaml
name: Crowdin Action

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  crowdin:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Synchronize with Crowdin
        uses: crowdin/github-action@v1
        with:
          upload_sources: true
          upload_translations: true
          download_translations: true
          localization_branch_name: l10n_crowdin_translations

          create_pull_request: true
          pull_request_title: 'New Crowdin translations'
          pull_request_body: 'New Crowdin pull request with translations'
          pull_request_base_branch_name: 'main'

          pull_request_labels: 'enhancement, good first issue'
          pull_request_assignees: 'crowdin-bot'
          pull_request_reviewers: 'crowdin-reviewer'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID }}
          CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
```

### Custom `crowdin.yml` file location

```yaml
...

- name: Crowdin
  uses: crowdin/github-action@v1
  with:
    config: '.github/crowdin.yml'

  ...
```

### Separate PRs for each target language

```yaml
name: Crowdin Action

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  crowdin:
    name: Synchronize with Crowdin
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      max-parallel: 1 # Should be 1 to avoid parallel builds
      matrix:
        lc: [uk, it, es, fr, de, pt-BR] # Target languages https://developer.crowdin.com/language-codes/
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Matrix
        uses: crowdin/github-action@v1
        with:
          upload_sources: false
          upload_translations: false
          download_translations: true
          commit_message: New Crowdin translations - ${{ matrix.lc }}
          localization_branch_name: l10n_main_${{ matrix.lc }}
          pull_request_base_branch_name: 'main'
          pull_request_title: New translations - ${{ matrix.lc }}
          download_language: ${{ matrix.lc }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID }}
          CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}

```

## Triggers

### Cron schedule

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */12 * * *' # Every 12 hours - https://crontab.guru/#0_*/12_*_*_*
```

### Manually

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### When a localization file is updated in the specified branch

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/locales/en.json'
    branches: [ main ]
```

### When a new GitHub Release is published

```yaml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

### Dealing with concurrency

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### Handling parallel runs

In case your action fails when a build is in progress (409 error code), you need to configure the workflow in a way to avoid parallel runs.

```yaml
strategy:
  max-parallel: 1
```
